      JavaScript has <strong>only one type of numbers</strong> â€“ 64-bit float point. It's the same as Java's double. Unlike most other programming languages, there is no separate integer type, so <code>1</code> and  <code>1.0</code> are the same value. <br /><br />

      In this chapter, we'll learn how to create numbers and perform operations on them (like additions and subtractions).

      <CodeSandbox slug="numbers/intro" initialCodeContent={`
// Create a variable answer and pi with the right values so you can pass the tests
`} testContent={`

testEquality(answer, 42);
testEquality(pi, 3.1416);
`} />
    </div>
